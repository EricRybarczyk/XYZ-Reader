# XYZ Reader
Project 6 towards my Android Developer Nanodegree

## Project Summary
Working from an existing app, we redesigned the app to follow Material Design guidelines. Mock feedback from users was incorporated into the improvements made to the app, including text readability, color scheme, and general UI flow.
